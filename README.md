# UserApplicationMaven

This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates how to use Maven for dependency management and build automation. 
It is a CRUD application that interacts with a H2 database.
There are 2 main tables GEBRUIKERS and USERS
Remark: The GEBRUIKERS table is used to store user information in many columns, while the USERS table is used to store gebruikers  information, with only 3 fields.
ID, EMAIL and NAME.  This makes it easier to manage and retrieve user data.
Normally GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE operations are implemented for both tables.
